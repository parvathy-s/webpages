	<p>Hey there! This is Parvathy Sajeev! I hope you're doing good and thank you for checking out my page! More on myself, I hail from The God's own country, Kerala and I'm a computer science student by day and an avid reader by night. I gush about my obsession for books over at my bookstagram page and you can find me happily spending my leisure time reviewing books and hordering ( and admiring ;) ) pretty editions of books. </p>
	<p>Anyhow, if you're interested in checking out my book reviews, you can head over to my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/booknerd65" target="_blank">GoodReads (hover here ;))</a> page and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/booknerd65/" target="_blank">Bookstagram (hover here ;))</a>! page</p>
